# Nectar
Welcome to Nectar, an Ecommerce app made for the client! 

## Functionality
### Current Functionality
Currently, Nectar is ran on the local, webscraping through different websites to optimize your shopping (and selling!) experience!

We have (as of 2023) a domain name for the future of Nectar! 

```www.nectar.compare```

Nectar is able to currently compare prices to similar items you are shopping for, and analyze market value for a product you want to sell!

To compare prices, and other cool statistcal related functionalities, direct yourself to the buy menu.

To see market price for an item you want to sell and other related cool statistical functiaonlities, direct yourself to the sell menu.

### Future Functionality
In the future, we want to be able to hold a database (using google cloud) of websites. This would prove as a way to include sponsored companies or websites, or a catered dataset of websites for specific key tags.

Another functionality we want to implement is a compare two items, and see which one the user should buy based on specific parameters from the webscrape call. 

We also would like to proper display the statistical modeling simulation for both our buy and sell, and use a bigger dataset upon further optimizatoion of algorithms.
